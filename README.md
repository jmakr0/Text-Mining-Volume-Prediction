# Text-Mining-in-Practice

## What's this all about?

Text Mining is the process of extracting and deriving information from unstructured text data. It involves Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning Methods, such as Probabilistic Graphical Models and Deep Learning.

This project seminar is about the practical application of Text Mining. Its focus is on a real-world dataset of millions of English-language comments that have been posted by users at discussion sections of online newspapers. Each group of students will work on one out of several different topics, such as:

* Hate Speech Detection
* Comment Volume Prediction
* Comment Ranking
* Modeling User's Commenting Behavior
* Discussion Summarization
* Modeling Linguistic Change
